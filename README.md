=======================

GMod Addon Adder Python v3.9.2

Automatically creates a line in a server's workshop.lua for a .GMA file and extracts the contents
to the server's addons folder using the game's built-in 'gmad.exe'.

## ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE SUBSCRIBED TO THE ITEM ON THE STEAM WORKSHOP BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO USE THIS ##

If you have your install directories set up, open config.py and input the respective directories.

Run main.py and you will be asked to paste the Steam workshop URL for each addon and give it a name.
The addon will automatically be added to the server's workshop.lua with a comment including the inputted name.

Once all the addons have been confirmed (press enter twice), gmad.exe will run, extracting all the addon's 
files and materials to the server's addons folder.

I made this to help shave a lot of time off creating a new GMod server and I hope others
can get some use out of this tool.
