=======================

GMod Addon Adder Python v3.9.2

Automatically creates a line in a server's workshop.lua for a .GMA and extracts the contents
to the server's addons folder using the game's built-in gmad.exe.

If you have your install directories set up, open config.py and paste the respective directories.
Otherwise, run main.py and it will ask for them.

You will then have to paste the URL for each addon and give it a name.
The addon will automatically be added to the server's workshop.lua.

Once all the addons have been confirmed (press enter twice), gmad.exe will run,
extracting all the addon's files and materials to the server's addons folder.

I made this help shave a lot of time off creating a new GMod server and I hope other's
can get some use out of this tool.
